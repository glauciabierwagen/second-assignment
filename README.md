# React App Portfolio

In this second assignment you are going to work with React and create a portfolio web page. I will not judge you on any styles or design so feel fre to use as less, or much, css styles as you want to. The design is not important and do not put too much time on it before you made sure that you have done all of the requirements in the assignment.

In this assignment you will practice:

- Routing in React, how to link to other pages.

- Creating components and rendering components in React.

- Practicing using state and working with events in React.

## Requirements
Components to create:

- *HomePage*: Display at least 1 image and a welcome/intro text about yourself. The HomePage should also include a button that links to the About Page.

- *AboutPage*: Display at least 2 images and 2 sections of text (does not have to be a lot of text).
- 
- *ContactPage*: You need to display a contact form. In the contact form a user should be able to type their name, email and a message. When the user click Submit the sent message should be displayed below the contact form and the input fields should be cleared.

- *Modal*: a pop-up window, called Modal, should be created by using useState() hook. You can display this Modal wherever you like. In my example I have a button that says "Book a Call" and the pop-up just displays some info about booking a call.

- *Header/Menu*: the Header/Menu should be displayed on all three pages and contain links to the different pages.

- *Footer*: the footer should contain your contact info and be displayed on all three pages in your app.
