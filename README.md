# React App Portfolio

In this second assignment you are going to work with React and create a portfolio web page. I will not judge you on any styles or design so feel fre to use as less, or much, css styles as you want to. The design is not important and do not put too much time on it before you made sure that you have done all of the requirements in the assignment.

In this assignment you will practice:

- Routing in React, how to link to other pages.

- Creating components and rendering components in React.

- Practicing using state and working with events in React.

## Requirements
Components to create:

- # HomePage: Display at least 1 image and a welcome/intro text about yourself. The HomePage should also include a button that links to the About Page.

- AboutPage: Display at least 2 images and 2 sections of text (does not have to be a lot of text).
- 
- ContactPage: You need to display a contact form. In the contact form a user should be able to type their name, email and a message. When the user click Submit the sent message should be displayed below the contact form and the input fields should be cleared.

- Modal: a pop-up window, called Modal, should be created by using useState() hook. You can display this Modal wherever you like. In my example I have a button that says "Book a Call" and the pop-up just displays some info about booking a call.

- Header/Menu: the Header/Menu should be displayed on all three pages and contain links to the different pages.

- Footer: the footer should contain your contact info and be displayed on all three pages in your app.



Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
